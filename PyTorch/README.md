### PyTorch
I studied PyTorch library from learnpytorch.io from Daniel Bourke.  
It's a very good source to learn pytorch.  
I recommend to everyone who want to be successful in machine learning.  
You can see codes in study.ipynb file and this code is computer vision section of the tutorial website.  
You can learn neural network, convolutional neural networks, loss function, optimizer, evaluation metrics, pooling, activation functions and more.
